        <h2>The astrology-like system uses birth dates to break <br>people into personality types and  even find love and <br> riches. From sleeping arrangements to diets, some are <br> taking it very seriously.</h2>

      <p><b>TRAVIS DAY REGRETS</b> being so strict with his ex-partner about never sleeping in the same bed.</p>
      <p>According to human design, the New Age “synthesis” of astrology, the I Ching book of Chinese wisdom, Kabbalah, and the chakra system, “everyone should sleep in their own bed at night” to preserve their auras, says the blond 38-year-old Los Angeles County–based surfer, who’s been following the practice rigidly for the past five years.</p>
      <p>“She was not happy and really hated having to go back to her place,” says Day, now a human design coach with 11,000 followers on Instagram. He didn’t know how much the “auric distancing” bothered her, he says, “until she finally expressed it when we were breaking up.”</p>
      <p>Human design dictates that people inevitably fall into five archetypal personality categories: “manifestors,” generators, manifesting generators, reflectors, and projectors. The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system turned Day’s life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020. He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but that initial personality analysis represented “the first time someone actually saw me.”</p>
      <p>Day was told that he was projector and that he shouldn’t hustle hard but instead follow the intuition of his spleen, the little-understood organ in the upper abdomen that is traditionally believed to be the seat of bad temper.</p>
      <p>“For a long time I had depression and talked terribly to myself,” the California native tells me over a Zoom call. “But human design showed me that I actually hated not being me.”</p>
      <p>Human design, a philosophy that spans from self-improvement to more extreme beliefs like life being predetermined, alien influence on Earth, and a coming planetary shift, is approaching a high-watermark cultural moment. It might not be long before the phrase, “that’s so mani-gen” is as common, in certain circles, as “that’s so Leo.” Some human design coaches have more than 100,000 followers on social media, offering people advice on everything from love lives to how to get rich.</p>
